# lemonic

Lemonic is yet another library to enjoy game programming.

## Installation

Just copy the lemonic.h file (and maybe example.c) to any directory, but you'll need to install SDL2 on your machine.

To build a project just copy the build.sh (or build.bat if you are on Windows) and change it to your needs (add other libraries and change file names).
